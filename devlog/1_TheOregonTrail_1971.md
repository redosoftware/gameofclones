### New Story

You are the captain of the spaceship CSS Oregon. Your mission: transport your crew from Earth through the Solar System and arrive safely in Titan's colony. The humans in Jupiter's moon are waiting for new members and medical supplies.

You won't be alone in this dangerous voyage, the spaceship AI S.A.G.A.N. (Sentient Astronomical Galactic Astronaut Navigator) will help you, sharing all its knowledge of the universe and alerting you about the perils among the stars.

You will count with supplies that you'll need to maintain and manage carefully to avoid any great loses. Your resources are:

* Food: people get hungry, specially in space.
* Crypto Units: for pruchasing more supplies or negotiate with space pirates.
* Energy Catridges: sometimes laser beams are the best way to negotiate.
* Spare Parts: to patch your ship after the negotiation process.
* Medical Supplies: to heal your wouded and also to deliver at destination.
