# Game of Clones
Making clones of classical video games to learn about their history, improve my dev skills and just for fun.

## Games
I'm going to follow [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best) that I found on Wikipedia.

## Tech
* C++ plus SDL. I spent the last ~8 years making games in Unity (and I will keep doing it in my day job) and I feel like I lost the 'hardcore' touch, I'll try to revive that.
* I'm not sure what I'll do once I reached the 3D games (I might create my own engine).

## Design and Narrative
* I won't copy the games 100%, I'll use the same game mechanics as the originals, but depending on the game, maybe I'll change some things.
* I'll come up with my own stories and characters.


## Art and Music
* Not sure about this, I'll see what I can come up with.
